\section{Discussion}
To mention:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Too much data conversion, rather do it once
	\item automating XQuery is hard, but might have saved time	
	\item students assigned to multiple sets, changes statistics
	\item splitting on student sets and teachers changes statistics
	\item teachers are sometimes split by space, we only detect \code{;}
	\item wasted hours: breaks included
\end{itemize}
