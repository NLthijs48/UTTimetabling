\section{Plan}
The global plan for the research is described in Figure \ref{fig:toolchain}. This shows the steps required to get to the results. The expectation is to get a table with the results of the KPI statistics and exploration statistics. Next to this we would like to have a couple of statistics per quartile, for example the number of hours on a day grouped into categories. We would like to present these results per quartile on a website using interactive bar graphs. This ensures the results are easy to access and also makes it easy to enable/disable parts of the graph.
