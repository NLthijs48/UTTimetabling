\section{Results}
After having translated the datasets into more workable and query-able formats, which on its own is quite a result already, the KPIs could be checked for their compliance. By writing and querying rather complex XQueries, we were able to check the compliance of the KPIs. See TABLE ??? for the obtained results.

Not only did we check the KPIs given by the University itself but we also came up with a few other analyses to point out some interesting discoveries in the data sets. As mentioned before, these results are displayed on the website \url{http://wiefferink.me/TimeTabling}.
