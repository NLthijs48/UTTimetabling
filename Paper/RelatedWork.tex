\section{Related Work}
The research of Burke and Petrovic \cite{recentResearchDirectionsInAutomatedTimetabling} introduce some approaches to timetabling problems that were developed or are under development at that time in the Automated Scheduling, Optimisation and Planning Research Group
(ASAP) at the University of Nottingham. Their aim was basically the same as in our research since they specifically concentrated upon university timetabling as well. The paper suggests a number of approaches and comprises three parts. Firstly, recent
heuristic and evolutionary timetabling algorithms are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments
are described: a method for decomposing large real-world timetabling problems and a method for heuristic
initialisation of the population. Secondly, an approach that considers timetabling problems as multicriteria decision
problems is presented. Thirdly, it discusses a case-based reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve
new timetabling problems which basically is similar to our research where we will be analysing past schedules to give indications for improving future schedules.
